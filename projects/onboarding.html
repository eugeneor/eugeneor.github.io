          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Clio customers can be broken down into 3 main personas. One of which can be described as non tech-savvy and may require some online tutorials to get over learning curves. For these types of customers, the Clio workflow may seem confusing at first, but after doing it once (maybe a few times for others), it should be fairly straight forward. We should design an on boarding tour focused on educating these customers which will in turn, also drive trial to paid conversions.</p>
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>This was my first project at Clio. So there was quite a bit to absorb. The first step would be to learn about the customers as well as the system they would be using. This was also my first time being exposed to the Clio codebase. Wow. I looked at many competitors, focusing mainly on their on boarding flows and feature introductions.</p>
          <p>After much research, I designed a topic and step workflow that would walk customers through the main parts of Clio. This included contact, matter, time, and bill creation. Bill creation is the wow moment. This is where they would get paid, so we emphasized that this process would no longer than 10 minutes. We congratulated them each step of the way, saving their process once a milestone was reached. Once the entire tour was completed, we gifted them with a referral credit towards a prize.</p>
          <p>To make it future proof, the tour was designed to include many more tours if we ever needed them. We included Google Analytics was also implemented to determine where customers were stumbling in the flow.</p>
          <h3>Success Metrics</h3>
